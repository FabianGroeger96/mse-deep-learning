    "*What are the benefits of using transfer learning ?*\n",
    "\n",
    " - Less training data is required to achieve the same accuracy for a given task\n",
    " - Training process will be faster\n",
    " - We can leverage data from a similar domain where it might be easier to gather such or there are already large datasets available (e.g. ImageNet)\n",

    "*What are the potential usage of auto-encoders ?*\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data compression\n",
    " - Dimensionality reduction\n",
    " - Train a feature extractor\n",
    " - Denoise the input data\n",
    " - Fill in missing gaps in the input data (e.g. image in-painting)\n",
    " - Learn good initializations for the weights of a deep neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "# (d)\n",
    "*In which situations would you use auto-encoders to extract features ?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataset for a given task is too small to train a neural network end-to-end, I would try to learn a good feature extractor by means of a autoencoder. I might prefer to train a variational autoencoder (VAE) because such a model would make it easier to interpret and hence cross check the learned latent space. "
