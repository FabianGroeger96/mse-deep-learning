    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "**Remark**: This document is intended for the students following the Machine Learning and Deep Learning class. We assume that students are knowledgeable in other programming languages such as Java or C and that basic data structure concepts are known. If you know already Python and iPython Notebooks (such as this document), then you can avoid reading the rest of this page. If you want a rather slow introduction to Python, read the official [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was released in 1991 and initially developed by Guido van Rossum (Holland). Python got inspiration from Modula 3, is object-oriented and can be easily extended. Good libraries are available to work with data, to visualize it and to model it with machine learning. This is why we have chosen to do most of the exercises with Python in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to work with Python\n",
    "You have basically 3 ways to work with Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a Python console in interactive mode. Just open a terminal and launch `python`.\n",
    "2. Using a text editor or an IDE to develop (saving \".py\" files), as you would do it in Java or C. A good IDE is [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from Jet Brains.\n",
    "3. Using a iPython notebook via a web browser. The concept is similar to Mathematica notebooks where you can mix code and text inputs (using Markdown) in so-called cells. This document is actually a \".ipynb\" file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this class we recommend to work with iPython Notebooks which is probably the best way to give us back your practical works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install iPython notebook, you may use the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) package. This is a free bundled installer of Python and other tools including the _Jupyter Notebook App_ (client-server application that allows editing and running notebooks). iPython notebooks are also supported in the IDE [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which version of Python to use?\n",
    "There are currently two \"concurrent\" versions of Python, versions 2 and 3. The Python world has now been strongly migrating towards using Python 3. The Python world has now been migrating strongly towards using Python 3 and we therefore recommend to use 3 instead of 2. Beware that Python 2 and Python 3 have some incompatible differences in language syntax. You may also find code examples and libraries on the web that did not move yet to version 3. Share your experience with us if you have any troubles! Now, let's start with some basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's start!\n",
    "In a notebook, you have different types of cells: **Markdown cells** (like this one) where you can input your text and format it with simple [syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/), and Python **Code cells** (like the one just below). You can switch from one type to the other using the dropdown list in the notebook toolbar or using one of the keyboard shortcuts. For shortcuts see the very useful `Help` menu above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute a code cell, just select it with the mouse (or navigate with the arrow keys after pressing ESC), and press `SHIFT-Enter`. "
